This is my machine learning project on Cardiac Disease Prediction using optimal feature subset selection (OFSS). The base paper for the project is given in the link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705122008644. I have performed analysis on three datasets containing the patient records with 14 features in total. The final model has been build on the combined dataset created by merging all the three datasets. I have performed a complete experimentaton starting from data peprocessing, optimal feature selection and hyperparamater tuning for 5 different models. As part of novelty, i have created a voting ensemble model using three different models, RF, SVM and KNN using the optimal hyperparamters. The final accuracy of the model is 99.72% and the final pipeline voting accuracy is 95.25%.
